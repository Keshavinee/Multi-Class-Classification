This model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks.
It has multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by fully connected layers. 
The use of convolutional layers allows the network to capture spatial features of the input images 
and detect patterns at different levels of abstraction.

The first convolutional layer takes as input the one color channel and applies 16 filters, each of size 3x3,
to produce 16 feature maps. The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity. The next layer is a 
max pooling layer that reduces the size of the feature maps by a factor of 2, thus reducing the number of 
parameters in the model and helping to prevent overfitting.

The process is repeated with another convolutional layer that applies 32 filters, and a second max pooling layer.Finally, 
a third convolutional layer applies 64 filters, followed by a third max pooling layer. The resulting feature maps are then 
flattened into a vector and fed into a fully connected layer of size 128, again with a ReLU activation function.

The output layer consists of 3 neurons, one for each class (no substructure, subhalo substructure, and vortex substructure), 
and uses the softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the classes. It is capable of capturing 
the relevant features in the input images and producing accurate predictions. However, the performance of the model can be 
further improved by fine-tuning the hyperparameters, increasing the depth of the network, or incorporating other techniques
such as regularization and data augmentation.
